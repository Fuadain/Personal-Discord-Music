# Personal-Discord-Music

A discord bot program I created for private use for playing music in a server as publicly used discord music bots violated Youtube's ToS due to their nature of public use. The executable for ffmpeg is required to be in the same folder to run. Main feature that current version is lacking is looping songs and queues.
